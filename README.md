Data Cleaning Drill
Data cleaning is definitely a "practice makes perfect" skill. 
In this challenge, you'll use this dataset of article open-access prices paid by the WELLCOME Trust between 2012 and 2013.

To complete this challenge, determine the five most common journals and the total articles for each. Next, calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the open-access cost per article for each journal.
